product.

## Project Description and Scope

1. Initial requirements gathering:
2. Solution scoping and pricing
3. Detailed solution design
4. Solution implementation

## Business case

As a plant enthusiast, I want to:

* have a hassle-free plant watering.
* fill one bigger water tank that should last for a few weeks,
  depending on the plant water consumption, and set up the watering device once.
* be able to set up the watering schedule based on my plant's needs. Using display and buttons.
* receive a mail notification when the water tank is nearly empty.

## Project objectives

* Automated Watering System: Develop an automated plant watering system that can efficiently and accurately deliver
  water
  to plants based on their specific needs.

* Sensor Integration: Integrate soil moisture sensors to accurately measure the moisture levels in the soil and provide
  real-time data for effective watering decisions.

* Customizable Watering Parameters: Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to customize watering parameters
  such as frequency, duration, and volume to cater to the specific requirements of different plant species.

* Energy-Efficient Design: Design the system with energy efficiency in mind, incorporating features such as low-power
  components, sleep modes, and efficient scheduling to minimize power consumption.

* Compatibility with Various Plant Types: Ensure the system is adaptable to different types of plants by considering
  variations in soil types, sunlight exposure, and individual plant water requirements.

* Remote Monitoring and Control: Implement a remote monitoring and control feature, allowing users to check the system
  status, receive alerts, and adjust watering settings through a mobile app or web interface.

* Water Conservation: Prioritize water conservation by implementing features such as rainwater harvesting integration,
  smart weather prediction, and the ability to adjust watering schedules based on environmental conditions.

* Reliability and Durability: Design a robust and durable system capable of withstanding outdoor conditions, including
  resistance to water exposure, temperature variations, and other environmental factors.

* User Education and Support: Provide comprehensive user documentation and support to ensure that users can easily set
  up,
  operate, and troubleshoot the system effectively.

* Cost-Effective Solution: Strive to create a cost-effective solution by optimizing the use of materials and components
  without compromising on the system's performance and reliability.

* Data Logging and Analysis: Implement a data logging feature to record historical soil moisture data, enabling users to
  analyze plant health trends over time and make informed decisions about watering adjustments.

* Scalability: Design the system with scalability in mind, allowing users to expand the system to accommodate a larger
  number of plants or additional features in the future.

* Integration with Smart Home Ecosystems: Explore possibilities for integrating the plant watering system with popular
  smart home ecosystems such as Google Home or Amazon Alexa for seamless home automation.

* Feedback Mechanism: Implement a feedback mechanism that allows users to receive notifications or alerts when the
  system
  encounters issues, ensuring timely intervention and maintenance.

* Aesthetic Integration: Consider the aesthetic aspects of the design to ensure that the plant waterer is visually
  appealing and can seamlessly blend into different garden or indoor environments.

## Description of Deliverables

## Assumptions

* We assume that the plant waterer system is designed for a specific range of plant types: indoor houseplants, of small
  and medium sizes.
* We assume that the system is designed to meet the basic watering requirements of the chosen plants.
* The frequency of and quantity of 5 liters of water is enough for the plants to survive for a few weeks.
* The system is designed to be used in a home environment, with access to a power source and WiFi connectivity.
* We assume a minimal maintenance requirement for the plant waterer.
* We assume that the system has components that can be easily replaced, the water can be easily refilled and cleaned.
* We assume that users will interact with the plant waterer through a user-friendly interface.
* We assume that the system has limitations related to materials and exposure to rain, water, sunlight, and other.

## Constraints

The end date of project is set to 27-01-2024. üóìÔ∏è

## Project Risks

Sensor Accuracy:

Risk: Soil moisture sensors may provide inaccurate readings, leading to overwatering or underwatering.
Mitigation: Conduct extensive testing and calibration of sensors under various soil conditions. Implement fail-safes to
prevent extreme watering based solely on sensor data.
Plant Variability:

Risk: Different plant species have varied water requirements, and the system may struggle to cater to the specific needs
of each plant.
Mitigation: Implement a customizable interface for users to input plant types and adjust watering parameters. Provide
guidance on optimal settings for common plant varieties.
Seasonal Changes:

Risk: Seasonal variations may impact plant water requirements, and the system may need adjustments to adapt.
Mitigation: Incorporate a weather prediction feature to anticipate seasonal changes. Allow users to set seasonal
preferences or implement adaptive algorithms.
Power Supply Interruptions:

Risk: Power interruptions may disrupt the system's operation, leading to potential harm to plants.
Mitigation: Design the system to handle power interruptions gracefully, with features like backup power sources or the
ability to resume operations after power is restored.
User Understanding:

Risk: Users may not fully understand the system's capabilities or may misconfigure watering settings.
Mitigation: Provide clear and accessible user documentation, conduct user training sessions, and implement user-friendly
interfaces to minimize the risk of misconfiguration.
Connectivity Issues:

Risk: Issues with the system's connectivity may hinder remote monitoring and control.
Mitigation: Implement robust and secure connectivity solutions. Provide offline functionality and alerts to notify users
of connectivity issues.
Material Durability:

Risk: Exposure to outdoor elements may impact the durability of the system's components.
Mitigation: Choose materials that are resistant to weather conditions and conduct thorough testing for durability under
different environmental scenarios.
Data Security and Privacy:

Risk: Concerns related to the security and privacy of user data, especially if the system involves data storage or
remote monitoring.
Mitigation: Implement strong data encryption, adhere to data protection regulations, and clearly communicate the
system's privacy features to users.
Budget Constraints:

Risk: Unexpected expenses may arise, leading to budget overruns and potential delays.
Mitigation: Conduct a thorough cost analysis, build in contingency funds, and regularly review the budget to identify
and address potential overruns.
Plant Health Monitoring:

Risk: Inability to monitor overall plant health beyond soil moisture levels.
Mitigation: Explore additional sensors or features for monitoring factors like sunlight exposure, temperature, and
nutrient levels to provide a more comprehensive picture of plant health.

1. Initial requirements gathering - Hey, what it is that you actually want

2. Solution scoping and pricing - Depending on needs (p.1) you put statements of work. Initial offer.
   Vary depending on the scope. Talk to key stakeholders and sponsor to understand goals. Migration, cost optimization,
   upscaling? What we are working with and trying to achieve.

3. Detailed solution design - Steps and tasks to perform. Take information and put together a solution design. How long
   it's gonna take? What resources? What infrastructure is going to look like? What policies and standards? Naming
   convetions, security, access management?

4. Solution implementation - Hand over to other teams? Solve it yourself? Perform the implementation.

5. Handover to operations - Then hand it over to operations with documentation, workshops, training and finally get a
   sign off from sponsor.
