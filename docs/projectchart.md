1. Initial requirements gathering - Hey, what it is that you actually want

2. Solution scoping and pricing - Depending on needs (p.1) you put statements of work. Initial offer.
Vary depending on the scope. Talk to key stakeholders and sponsor to understand goals. Migration, cost optimization, upscaling? What we are working with and trying to achieve.

3. Detailed solution design - Steps and tasks to perform. Take information and put together a solution design. How long it's gonna take? What resources? What infrastructure is going to look like? What policies and standards? Naming convetions, security, access management?

4. Solution implementation - Hand over to other teams? Solve it yourself? Perform the implementation.

5. Handover to operations - Then hand it over to operations with documentation, workshops, training and finally get a sign off from sponsor.
