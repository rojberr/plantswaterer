### Raspberry Pi Pico W, RP2040 + WLAN

Introduced by Raspberry Pi in January 2021, is the first Microcontroller in RAspberry Pi Family, powered by RP2040 MCU,
with multiple PWM-capable I/O ports, I2C, SPI, ADC.

Raspberry Pi Pico is a flexible, low cost microcontroller development board from the folks at Raspberry Pi, based on
their very own chip - the RP2040. It's easily programmable over USB with C/C++ or MicroPython, and ideal for using in
all sorts of physical computing projects, devices and inventions - we're so excited to see what you make with it!

We've called our Pico-sized add-ons packs, as they're designed to attach to the back of your Pico as if it were wearing
a very stylish back pack (or a miniature jet pack, if you prefer). We've also got Pico bases (larger add-on boards with
a space to mount your Pico on top) and some other boards that let you do interesting hackerly things like using multiple
packs at once - click here to view them all!

### Pimoroni PIM543 Display

Pico Display lets you turn a Pico into a compact user interface device for a bigger project, capable of giving
instructions, displaying readouts and even incorporating elaborate nested menus. If you'd rather use your Pico as a
standalone device you could make a little rotating slideshow of images, display beautiful graphs from sensor data or
build your own Tamagotchi or matchbox sized text adventure game.

Pico Display Pack communicates with the LCD display via SPI on pins LCD_CS, LCD_DC, LCD_SCLK, and LCD_MOSI. We also PWM
the BL_EN pin (with gamma correction) for full, linear, backlight control. LCD_RESET is tied to the RUN pin on Pico so
the LCD will be fully reset whenever Pico is.

The four switches are wired up as SW_A, SW_B, SW_X, and SW_Y.

There is also an onboard RGB LED (ideal to use an activity indicator!) which is also PWMed (with gamma correction) on
pins LED_R, LED_G, and LED_B. If you want to use the LED pins for something else there are three cuttable traces on the
underside of the board.

Power is supplied through 3V3 meaning that you can use Pico Display Pack both on USB power and from external supplies (
from 1.8V to 5.5V) making it ideal for battery powered projects.

### Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2

The "Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2" is designed for measuring the moisture content in soil, using capacitive
sensing rather than resistive sensing which makes it less prone to corrosion. It operates on 3.3V to 5V, providing an
analog output proportional to the moisture level, and is compatible with microcontroller platforms like Arduino.

### 5V 1 Channel Relay Module

The "5V 1 Channel Relay Module" is an electronic switch that allows a low-power signal to control a higher power
circuit. Operating at 5V, it features a single channel, ideal for interfacing with microcontrollers like Arduino for
various automation tasks. The module includes an onboard LED indicator for relay operation and provides both normally
open and normally closed output options for versatile application in control systems.
